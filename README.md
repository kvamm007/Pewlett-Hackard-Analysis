# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

Throughout report Pewlett-Hackard will be referred to as PH for brevity

## Overview

PH had noticed that it seemed as though quite a few of their employees were nearing retirement age at the same time, and wanted further analysis done to confirm this hypothesis. With this confirmed, they desired further information as to how many staff, from which roles. They also wanted to pilot a mentorship program where soon to retire employees would retire part time, but stay on in a mentorship capacity to a younger and newer employee in the same (or very similar) role, to help get newer staff up to speed in order to prepare for the expected wave of retirements. This also offers a good opportunity for older staff to ease into retirement by going to part time before fully retiring, which many employees view as a good way to transition. 

## Results

1.	Approximately 30% of the workforce is nearing retirement age- so PH was correct in their feeling that this is an event they need to thoroughly prepare for.
2.	The titles losing the most employees, by a large margin, are Senior Engineer and Senior staff- with the next two being Engineer and Staff. It appears they may indeed be losing a large percentage of their more senior roles, leaving them with more junior employees. An employee departing a senior role would be optimally positioned to mentor a staff in the junior role.

3. Unfortunately, of those employees that are considered eligible for the mentorship program, the largest concentration of them are already in “Senior” roles, which may not be as in need of mentoring. PH may wish to conduct further analysis to see if any of the Senior positions are recent promotions within the last year; otherwise, those jobs are unlikely to gain much from a mentorship, as they have already achieved a senior level in their career.

4. There are no current managers that are eligible for the mentorship program. PH may wish to conduct further analysis on which 2 departments are set to lose their managers (above, 2 managers in retirement pool) and review senior staff in those departments- for example, if a Staff manager and an Engineering manager are leaving, there may be good candidates for promotion & mentorship amongst the senior versions of those staff members. 

## Summary

-	Within the next 3-5 years we can expect around 90,000 employees to retire. This appears to be around 30% of the workforce- so this is not necessarily a major cause for concern. Typically turnover for most companies is generally between 10-15% per year, so 30% over 3-5 years is not  necessarily a concern. However, with the large percentage of retirements expected, PH should also focus heavily on retention of current staff not near retirement age as well as recruitment of new staff. 
-	Reviewing total counts by department, all of the departments should have plenty of people available to act in the role of mentor; since the number of mentors per department greatly outpaces the number of employees identified as candidates for mentorship, that will leave PH with the option to only use their very top performers for mentors in the program. 
-	In addition to pulling a list of retirees by job title, there is a large discrepancy between those available to mentor and those needing mentorship. While having a much larger pool of mentors ensures that PH can choose only its top performers to mentor the new generation of workers, it also seems there will be a lot of positions needing to be filled by staff that have not received mentoring. PH should focus on immediate recruitment for some of those roles, particularly entry level roles, to make use of their new program. 
-	As it was difficult to tell from raw numbers, total staff listed per department and total staff expected to retire numbers were pulled and compared in order to have a percentage of staff expected to retire in each department. This helps PH determine if there are any departments particularly vulnerable to the coming wave- however, the departments are evenly distributed, with the largest difference being about 1%. This means the initiative should truly be a company wide program and not focused to specific departments or roles.

In total, it seems that PH is right to start planning and strategizing ahead of time, however, the expected retirement does not need to be cause for alarm as long as they are able to retain a large portion of their non-retirement aged staff, as well as recruit new staff into the organization. 

One data discrepency to note is that current staff by title and current staff by department are off by around 20,000; it is possible that PH is missing department records, or has department records errantly ending early, and should review this table for data integrity. We had also noticed early in our analysis that it seemed there were several departments without managers, which supports the theory that data may be missing.
